# Project: Taxonomic Data Analysis

This project provides a Python-based workflow for analyzing taxonomic species data and generating summary statistics and visualizations. The objective is to process a given dataset (taxonomic_data.csv), produce a summary of species counts by phylum, calculate averages, and create a bar chart visualization. The process is containerized using Docker for easy setup and reproducibility.

Overview
Key Steps:

Data Input: A CSV file containing taxonomic classifications and associated species counts.
Processing & Summarization:
Compute the total species count for each phylum.
Calculate the average species count per species within each phylum.
Visualization: Generate a bar chart (phylum_species_count.png) that displays the total species count per phylum.
Output: Write processed summary results to phylum_summary.csv and produce the visualization image.
Technologies & Tools:

Python 3: Core language for data processing and analysis.
Pandas: Data manipulation and aggregation.
Matplotlib: Creating the bar chart.
Docker: Containerization for a reproducible environment.
Repository Contents
analysis_script.py: The main Python script that reads input data, performs calculations, and generates outputs.
taxonomic_data.csv: Example input dataset containing the taxonomic information.
phylum_summary.csv: Output CSV file containing summarized results.
phylum_species_count.png: Bar chart visualization generated by the script.
requirements.txt: Python dependencies.
Dockerfile: Instructions for building the Docker image.
Task_1.pdf: Background task description and requirements.
README.md: This documentation file.
Running the Analysis
Prerequisites
Docker installed on your machine.
The input CSV file (taxonomic_data.csv) available in your working directory.
Steps
Build the Docker image:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t taxonomic-analyzer .
Run the Container: Run the container, mounting your current directory so the script can access input data and write output files:

bash
Copy code
docker run -v $(pwd):/data taxonomic-analyzer \
python analysis_script.py --input /data/taxonomic_data.csv --output /data
Explanation:

-v $(pwd):/data: Mounts your current directory to /data inside the container.
--input /data/taxonomic_data.csv: Specifies the input file location inside the container.
--output /data: The output files (phylum_summary.csv and phylum_species_count.png) will be saved to your host directory.
Check the Outputs: After the container finishes running, you should see:

phylum_summary.csv in your working directory with the summarized results.
phylum_species_count.png as a bar chart visualization of total species count by phylum.
Notes & Assumptions
The script handles missing or invalid data gracefully by treating missing counts as zero and filtering out rows with missing phylum information.
This workflow can be adapted by modifying the input dataset or adjusting the script logic.
If you need to install or update dependencies, edit the requirements.txt file and rebuild the Docker image.
